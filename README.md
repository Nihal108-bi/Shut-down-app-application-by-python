# Shut-down-app-application-by-python
The Shutdown App is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Tkinter in Python. This application provides a convenient way to perform common system actions, such as restarting, shutting down, and logging out. The user interface features four buttons, each corresponding to a specific action: Restart, Restart with a timer, Log-Out, and ShutDown. Upon clicking a button, a confirmation message will be displayed using the Tkinter messagebox module, ensuring that the user has the option to confirm or cancel the action. The underlying commands for system actions use the os.system function, allowing for seamless integration with the operating system's shutdown mechanisms. This project is beginner-friendly and serves as a practical example for those looking to create simple GUI applications using Tkinter in Python. Feel free to customize and expand upon the code according to your preferences and requirements.
